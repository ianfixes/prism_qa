# Vivisector

Vivisector helps you see inside your apps.  It compares design "master" images to a set of images from various implementations.


## Requirements

You supply the input images.  You supply the output images.  You follow a format for all the image filenames.  Vivisector really doesn't do much there; it simply generates reports.
